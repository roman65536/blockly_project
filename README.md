This a bit wild idea but give a try...

Project Management may be a challenging task, to keep all the task etc in order and keep track on other things among a Project.
Using Blockly Project Management, it easy to create and use Projects. It is a set of small programms, which are keeping the relevant data with a Postgresql DB.
In the set is also a Program, which generate kinda "Customer" ready Document using lualatex with all the information from the Project DB.
